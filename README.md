# PURPOSE

This repository will show you how to do the following:
1. Download weather data using Government of Canada web resources
1. Create an interactive map using `Jupyter`
2. Build an interactive dashboard using the `Plotly-Dash` library

## BACKGROUND

Weather data is a critical component to agriculture related analytics. However; reliable historical weather data in Canada is not very accessible. Instead, data generated by climate models are used to make predictions of future scenarios. Below is a link to the `Canadian Climate Atlas`:

> https://climateatlas.ca/map/canada/plus30_2030_85#

This map gives you historical data, where applicable. They also give you the `Ensemble mean`, basically an average of all 24 climate models. If you compare the `Historical` data to the `Ensemble mean`, you'll appreciate why I've created this repository.

## Climate Data Portals

Regardless of my opinion on climate models, the Government of Canada provides the following climate tools, found on their [Display and download climate data](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/canadian-centre-climate-services/display-download.html) webiste. These tools are:

> [Climate Atlas of Canada](https://climateatlas.ca/)

> [Climate Data](https://climatedata.ca/download/#station-download)

> [Power Analytics and Visualizations for Climate Science (PAVICS)](https://pavics.ouranos.ca/index.html)

But bulk downloading from these sites is quite limited.

# DOWNLOAD WEATHER DATA USING GOVERNMENT OF CANADA WEB RESOURCES

The Government of Canada's website for [Advanced tools for accessing datasets](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/canadian-centre-climate-services/display-download/advanced-tools.html), under the `Web Accessible Folder` section, there is a link to an endpoint. This endpoint allows you to use the [Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/msc-datamart/amqp_en/) to access weather data, and climate models.

Below is the link to this endpoint:

## INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

In order to use this notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

> pip install metpx-sr3

> pip install amqplib

The first notebook in this repository: **HOLD** provides examples of how to use Python to access this information.

## WEATHER STATIONS

The weather stations used in these maps are found in a `csv` file online, on the Government of Canada's website for [Advanced tools for accessing data](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/canadian-centre-climate-services/display-download/advanced-tools.html).
On this website, there is a link to a website for a [Web Accessible Folder](https://dd.weather.gc.ca/climate/observations/). This folder contains a list of weather stations, along with daily, hourly, monthly climate data.

You can also access data by weather station by using the follwoing link:
